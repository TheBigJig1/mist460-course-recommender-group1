Hospital Alert System

# USER STORIES
1. As an ER doctor, 
I need a system that gathers data to predict how many staff members we would need  during a specific season since I have been very understaffed the past 3 Christmas Eves.

2. As an ER nurse, 
I need a system that forecasts supply requirements (such as IV fluids) for predictable events like football games so that we are adequately stocked for patient care.

3. As a Trauma doctor, 
I need a system that issues alerts about expected spikes in accident-related admissions so the hospital is better prepared for Labor Day and football games nights drunk drivers.

4. As an EMT, 
we are always short-staffed for the demand on New Year's Eve.

5. As a volunteer, 
I need a system that highlights peak workload times so that I can better plan my availability and avoid being overwhelmed by sudden demand

6. As a medical distributor, 
I need a system that monitors hospital usage patterns and predicts supply needs to provide hospitals with everything they need at any moment

7. As a hospital administrator, 
I want a system that forecasts patient surges based on seasonal and local data, so that I can optimize staff schedules and prepare resources in advance
